error[E0277]: the trait bound `bounded_types::BoundedI64<0_i64, 10_i64>: From<f32>` is not satisfied

  = help: the following implementations were found:
            <bounded_types::BoundedI64<MIN, MAX> as From<i128>>
            <bounded_types::BoundedI64<MIN, MAX> as From<i16>>
            <bounded_types::BoundedI64<MIN, MAX> as From<i32>>
            <bounded_types::BoundedI64<MIN, MAX> as From<i64>>
          and 8 others
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Into<bounded_types::BoundedI64<0_i64, 10_i64>>` for `f32`
